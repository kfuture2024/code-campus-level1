# code-campus-level1 Day 13


## Task1
- You have created a login page in day 11 challenge and added the validations on it.
- Now create a file called index.js. Move the javascript code to that file.
- Refer to the file via a script tag in index.html file.

## Task 2
- Locally create an object like below:
```
[{
    username: "User1",
    password: "Password1"
},
{
    username: "User1",
    password: "Password1"
},
.
.
...]
```
- Validate if the username and password are part of this list.
- Show a message that you are logged in.

## Task 3 (Extra - level up)
- Try to create another html file called home.html.
- If the user name and password are correct - show the user with home.html.
- Note: This is just for understanding and we will not use this exact approach in frameworks like Angular. For this task - try to explore on **How to implement Routing in javascript frontend? What is Routing? etc..*
