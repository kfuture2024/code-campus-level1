# code-campus-level1 Day 7

## Learn
- [Promises](https://javascript.info/async)

## Task1
- Make the API call from Javascript - Call this API: [https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)
- Check the type of the response.
- Iterate over the response and print each country name

## Task2
- Create a seperate function which calls the API.
- Call that function and return the names of countries.
- Print the response from your function

```
//define your function
//your function makes the call to the API mentioned
//call your function
//Print the Country names
```
### Use Async await here


## Task3

- Call an error function like below
```
async function myNewError() {
  throw new Error("Test Error");
}
```
- Handle the error

## Task 4
- Create 3 promises of your own
- Print response after all of them resolved
- Print response after any one of them are resolved

## Task 5
- Read more resources and experiment on Promises and Async await 
- Explore when is it essential to use Async Await and Promise.then
- Understand various ways of Error handling
